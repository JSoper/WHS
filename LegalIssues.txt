A review of the legal issues with the World Heritage Sites ...

In summary, they are similar to that of iTunes. It, they have this data in XML format, which is an
invitation to use it, but on other pages, they seem to say they don't want you to use it.
We would eventually benefit from a clarification from them - can we use the data or not?

Somewhere in the site, I remember reading that it was OK to use the data, as long as your site
was free. Unfortunately, I cannot locate that statement right now. If I can find it, I think, we
would have to open-source the "solution" app, as well as make clear that Ext JS is available
under GPL3.

I had had it in the back of my mind to do a mobile app with this data, and offer it to them for
free. I think they would say OK. Getting an OK about using their data for a website exercise I 
think is doable, but not a slam-dunk. They already have a website.
