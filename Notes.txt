Issues for World Heritage Sites app
(sent to Max and Lee 1/28/13

LOCAL FILES

o Since the website only provides data in XML format, and ExtJS does not seem to have
   means to read XML remotely, we have to use local files.

IMAGES

o We run into problems similar with iTunes - how to get images somewhere in the app
   where it makes sense. Doesn't look good in a grid, and can't jam it into a form.

o The problem with images in the WHS case has been eliminated, as on rereading
   legal stuff, UNESCO does not own the rights to the images. So we would have to
   get approval from each of the hundreds of sites we are using to include the image.
   Bummer.

URL & FORMS

o Each WH Site has a url associated with it. That would be nice to have as a 
   link on the Detail Panel. Forms do not make this easy.
   
MAPS

o We cannot use maps without index.html, as opposed to the app.html that Architect uses,
   because we need to load in http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true
   Attempts to use in WhsController.#onLaunch the following code:
       Ext.data.JsonP.request({ url : "http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js", params: { sensor : true } } )
   result in a bug. The fact that we have to use index.html instead of app.html is outside the
   recommended practice of Architect, at least in the beginning.
   
o  If we use maps, the updating needs to be dead easy, as controllers work on
   components, and does not respond to a click on a map marker
   See MapPanel#onMarkerClick
   Normally I would share code between the MapPanel and the WhsController using
   a mixin. This adds a bit of complication that we probably should not have in a 1st day app.
